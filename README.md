# Article-Similarity-Checker
## data structure implementation of checking similarity between two files on word level with time Complexity of O(nlog(n)) using binary search tree, linked list and hash mapping

it checks the similer words between two text files and repetition of words in an eficient way by using a Binary Search Tree where the indexes of the repeated words are stored in a linked list in BST nodes and they are indexed in BST using a hash Map.
